                This survey uses a short version of "Big Five" personality model. It assumes that personality
                is a combination of five independent factors: Emotional <em>Stability</em>,
                <em>Extroversion</em>, <em>Openness</em> for Experiences,	<em>Agreeableness</em>,
                <em>(Conscientiousness)</em>. The figure shows the relation of these factors we
                calculated from your test results. This model is very useful to describe aspects
                of personality the test does not represent the entire complexity of a human being.
                The model gives a frame that we use to match you with jobs other people with your
                personality liked.
